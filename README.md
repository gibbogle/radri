# radri
Source code for model to simulate in vitro killing of cancer cells

The RaDRI model simulates the effect of a dose of radiation on cells in vitro, possibly in the presence of a drug that inhibits DNA repair.
Simulations reproduce the conditions of lab experiments, and generate estimates of the survival fraction of cells at clonogenic assay.
Optionally the model can generate distributions of cell cycle phase.
The code is Fortran90, and has been built using the Intel compiler with Visual Studio 2019.
